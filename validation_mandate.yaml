# validation_mandate.yaml
#
# This file defines the performance and risk criteria that a new parameter
# set must meet during advanced backtesting before it can be automatically
# promoted to the production config.yaml.

# --- Walk-Forward Validation Mandate ---
# Criteria applied to the results of the walk-forward analysis. This ensures
# the strategy is robust across different market regimes.
walk_forward_mandate:
  # The average Sharpe Ratio across all out-of-sample folds must exceed this value.
  min_avg_sharpe_ratio: 1.0
  
  # The worst-performing out-of-sample fold must still have a Sharpe Ratio above this value.
  # This prevents promoting a strategy that is brilliant most of the time but fails catastrophically.
  min_sharpe_ratio_in_any_fold: 0.5
  
  # The average max drawdown across all out-of-sample folds must be less than this value (as a positive number).
  max_avg_drawdown_pct: 15.0

# --- Monte Carlo Simulation Mandate ---
# Criteria applied to the distribution of outcomes from the Monte Carlo simulation.
# This ensures the strategy's success is not just statistical luck.
monte_carlo_mandate:
  # The 5th percentile of the CAGR distribution must be positive.
  # This ensures that even in unlucky scenarios, the strategy is not expected to lose money.
  min_cagr_at_5th_percentile: 0.0
  
  # The 5th percentile of the max drawdown distribution must be less than this value.
  # This is a critical risk check: what is the worst-case drawdown we can statistically expect?
  max_drawdown_at_5th_percentile: 20.0

# --- Historical Scenario Mandate ---
# Criteria applied to the performance during specific historical crises. This ensures
# the strategy can survive known "black swan" events.
scenario_mandate:
  # The maximum drawdown during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis scenario must be less than this.
  max_drawdown_in_2008_gfc_pct: 25.0
  
  # The maximum drawdown during the 2020 COVID Crash scenario must be less than this.
  max_drawdown_in_2020_covid_pct: 20.0
